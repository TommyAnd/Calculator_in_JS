# JavaScript Calculator

This is a calculator written in JavaScript by me ([@EnryBarto](https://github.com/EnryBarto)).
This is my first JavaScript project.

It can do additions, subtractions, multiplications, divisions, exponentiations and square roots.

"+" → Addition

"-" → Subtraction

"*" → Multiplication

"/" → Division

"^" → Exponentiation

"sqrt" → Square root
